# Geojson Visualisation Of Non-Orthogonal Building Polygons

## Building polygons that contain angles other then Quasi-Orthogonal 

Filtering an OSM Building Polygons file for buildings that deviate to a certain degree from Quasi-Orthogonal let's produce a Ratio Indicator of Not quasi-orthogonal polygons and an output file for buildings to look at more closely to explain deviations from orthogonality.
<br/>**Quasi-orthogonal angles definition** : angles [ between 85 - 95 degrees (quasi right angle) , or 175 - 185 degrees (quasi straigth line) ]
